 * - It only handles `GET` and `HEAD` requests.
 * - It resolves the requested path relative to the specified root directory.
 * - If the file exists, it reads it and sends it as a response with the correct MIME type.
 * - If the file does not exist or an error occurs, it calls `next()` to allow other middleware or routes to handle the request.

/**
 * This middleware provides a simple static file server for custom frameworks.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Serves files from a given root directory (e.g., public, assets, uploads).
 * - Automatically determines MIME types based on file extensions.
 * - Supports GET and HEAD HTTP methods.
 * - Falls back to the next middleware when a file isnâ€™t found.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   const serveStatic = require("./serve-static");
 *   app.use(serveStatic("public"));
